<ul>
<li>the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe

or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to
the Content;</li>
<li>you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to
the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass
through to end users any required terms;</li>
<li>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms,
malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>
<li class="important">the Content is not spam, is not machine- or

unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the
source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>

effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by upload or
otherwise.</li>

<li><strong>Responsibility of Website Visitors.</strong> upload has
not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer
software, posted to the Website, and cannot therefore be responsible for

upload does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there
posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or
non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to
protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan
horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Website may contain
content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well
as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and
other errors. The Website may also contain material that violates the

not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a
non-upload website or webpage, upload does not represent or imply
that it endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking
precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems
from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
content. upload disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting
from your use of non-upload websites and webpages.</li>

asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the
intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that material
located on or linked to by upload violates your copyright, you are
encouraged to notify upload in accordance with <a href="/dmca/">upload’s Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (&#8221;DMCA&#8221;) Policy</a>. upload will respond
to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the
infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. In
the case of a visitor who may infringe or repeatedly infringes the
copyrights or other intellectual property rights of upload or others,
upload may, in its discretion, terminate or deny access to and use of
the Website. In the case of such termination, upload will have no
obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to
upload.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property.</strong> This Agreement does not
transfer from upload to you any upload or third party intellectual
property, and all right, title and interest in and to such property will
remain (as between the parties) solely with upload. upload,

graphics and logos used in connection with upload, or the Website are

discretion, to modify or replace any part of this Agreement. It is your
responsibility to check this Agreement periodically for changes. Your
continued use of or access to the Website following the posting of any
changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes.
upload may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features
through the Website (including, the release of new tools and resources).
Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Termination. </strong>upload may terminate your access to
all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or
without notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this
Agreement or your upload account (if you have one), you may simply

<li class="important"><strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong> In no
event will upload, or its suppliers or licensors, be liable with
respect to any subject matter of this agreement under any contract,

and warrant that (i) your use of the Website will be in strict accordance
with the upload Privacy Policy, with this Agreement and with all
applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local

area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all
applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from
the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of
the Website will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property
rights of any third party.</li>
<li><strong>Indemnification.</strong> You agree to indemnify and hold
harmless upload, its contractors, and its licensors, and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any

revised version. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides
otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of the Website will be
governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its
conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising
out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts
located in San Francisco County, California. Except for claims for
injunctive or equitable relief or claims regarding intellectual property
rights (which may be brought in any competent court without the posting of
a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled
in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators
appointed in accordance with such Rules. The arbitration shall take place
in San Francisco, California, in the English language and the arbitral
decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any action
or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and
attorneys’ fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable, that part will be construed to reflect the parties’
original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and
effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this
Agreement or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such
term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your
rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to
be bound by, its terms and conditions; upload may assign its rights
under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding
upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and
